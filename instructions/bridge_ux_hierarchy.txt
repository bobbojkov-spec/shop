BRIDGE513 – UX HIERARCHY & SCROLL-DEPTH ANALYSIS
=================================================

GOAL ASSUMPTION
---------------
Primary:
- Sell handmade ceramics (products) and get users into the Shop flow.

Secondary:
- Build brand story (designers, workshop, editorial content).
- Provide trust signals and support paths (Help, Contact, About Us).


GLOBAL PRIORITY (TOP TO BOTTOM)
-------------------------------
1. Navigation + Brand (HEADER)
2. Product Discovery (Product Grid, Shop links)
3. Brand Story (Designers highlight, blog posts)
4. Engagement + Community (Workshop promo, gallery)
5. Support + Info (Footer widgets)
6. Legal & credits (Footer bottom)


ABOVE-THE-FOLD (FIRST VIEWPORT)
-------------------------------
Elements likely visible without scrolling on desktop:
- Sticky header with logo + navigation + search + cart
- Hero feature strip with 3 key themed cards (“INSPIRED BY THE SEA”, etc.)

UX implications:
- Users immediately see the brand aesthetic and thematic concepts.
- There is no classic single hero banner with one primary CTA; instead, the page offers three parallel entry points (three cards).

Possible optimization:
- Add a single dominant CTA (e.g., “Shop New Collection”) above or below the hero strip to consolidate intent.


EARLY SCROLL (FIRST 1–2 SCREEN HEIGHTS)
---------------------------------------
Key sections:
- ProductGridSection (featured products)
- “VIEW ALL” shop CTA

User behavior expectations:
- Users scrolling a bit should quickly encounter concrete products and prices.
- Product cards include wishlist and add-to-cart buttons, which is strong for conversion.

UX priorities:
- Primary conversion: clicking on a product or adding to cart.
- Secondary: clicking “VIEW ALL” to explore the full catalog.

Potential improvements:
- Ensure price and CTA are visually prominent enough vs. surrounding whitespace.
- Add labels like “Best Sellers” / “Featured Pieces” to guide users.


MID SCROLL (STORY & CREDIBILITY)
--------------------------------
Sections:
- DesignersHighlight (“MEET DESIGNERS EVA & NINA”)
- BlogPreviewSection (3 blog cards)

Intended UX role:
- Humanize the brand (EVA & NINA as real designers).
- Provide narrative and context (work, inspirations, events).
- Improve SEO and perception of thought leadership via blog content.

Visual priority:
- Still medium-high; headings and imagery should retain attention.
- Use strong typography and imagery so this section doesn’t feel like filler between product blocks.

Behavior expectations:
- Users inclined to storytelling and context (vs pure shopping) will read more.
- Some users will click through to About / Blog and may convert later after exploring.


MID-LATE SCROLL (ENGAGEMENT CTA)
--------------------------------
Section:
- WorkshopPromoSection (“WORKSHOP IN OUR CERAMIC STUDIO”, “APPLY NOW”)

Role:
- Strong CTA for highly engaged users.
- Offers an offline/experiential dimension to the brand.

Priority:
- For general e-commerce users: secondary.
- For local or fans-of-brand users: primary/valuable.

UX considerations:
- Position near the middle to end of scroll so mainly committed users see it.
- Ensure “APPLY NOW” stands out visually (color contrast, size, whitespace).


LATE SCROLL (MOOD & LIFESTYLE)
------------------------------
Section:
- GalleryStrip (multi-image strip, Instagram-like moodboard)

Role:
- Emotional reinforcement of brand vibe (handmade, artistic, coastal/natural themes).
- Light secondary CTA if images are linked to Instagram or product pages.

Priority:
- Lower than product grid and workshop CTA, but still visually engaging.
- Works as a visual “reward” near the bottom of the page.


FOOTER (SUPPORT & SAFETY NET)
-----------------------------
Sections:
- FooterWidgetArea (search, contact, Help, About Us, Customer Services)
- FooterBottom (copyright)

Role:
- Navigation safety net for oriented users (“I want FAQ”, “I need contact details”, “Where are your stores?”).
- Trust & legitimacy via address, phone, and links to policy pages.

UX expectations:
- Users in problem-solving or information-seeking mode will naturally scroll here if they cannot find answers above.
- All key support paths present:
  - “Track Your Order”
  - “Returns”
  - “My Account”
  - “Terms of Use”, etc.


SCROLL-DEPTH TIERING
--------------------
TIER 1 – MUST SEE (0–1 viewport)
- Header (logo, nav, search, cart)
- HeroFeatureStrip

TIER 2 – HIGH VALUE (1–2.5 viewports)
- ProductGridSection
- “VIEW ALL” CTA to shop

TIER 3 – SUPPORTING STORY (2.5–4 viewports)
- DesignersHighlight
- BlogPreviewSection

TIER 4 – ENGAGEMENT & COMMUNITY (4–5 viewports)
- WorkshopPromoSection
- GalleryStrip

TIER 5 – SAFETY & SUPPORT (5+ viewports)
- Footer widgets (Help, About Us, Customer Services)
- Footer legal


UX RISKS & OPPORTUNITIES
------------------------
1) Hero with 3 equal cards
   - Risk: No single dominant CTA; users may not know what to click first.
   - Opportunity: Turn one card into a “featured collection” hero with stronger emphasis.

2) Product grid position
   - Positive: Appears early—good for commerce.
   - Opportunity: Add labels like “New arrivals” / “Best sellers” and visible section heading.

3) Designers & blog sections
   - Benefit: Strong for brand-building and SEO.
   - Risk: Can feel like content detour if not clearly linked back to products.

4) Workshop CTA
   - Good: High-commitment CTA for loyal/engaged users.
   - Needs: Clear explanation of benefits, limited spots, schedule, or location for urgency/clarity.

5) Footer density
   - Positive: All needed support links are present.
   - Risk: Dense blocks of text may be overwhelming; consider grouping and icon usage.


RECOMMENDED UX ADJUSTMENTS (SUMMARY)
------------------------------------
- Clarify one “Primary Path”:
  - E.g., “Shop the collection” button in or just below hero.
- Highlight product section with a clear heading.
- Add “View all products” CTA near top of page as well as within product section.
- Ensure all CTAs (“learn more”, “READ MORE”, “APPLY NOW”) visually indicate their differences in priority:
  - Primary = filled button
  - Secondary = outlined
  - Tertiary = text link
